## How to Use

Use the sliders to select the number of syllables and number of names to generate. Each name will be generated with a random selection of syllables based on the number of syllables selected.

Each name will have the same number of syllables.

Names can easily be regenerated using the same settings, or adjusting the sliders for for new settings.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
